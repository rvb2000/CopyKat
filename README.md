# CopyKat
Simple game using pixiJs.

Run any local server (xampp, apache etc..) before running the file. No need to download anything else.

Make Sure your web browser supports WebGL, prefer firefox for better experience and adjust the screen by zooming out or zooming in for better layout, I prefer 90% zoom.
